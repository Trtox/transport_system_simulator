# Transport System Simulator

JavaFX app that finds optimal routes between cities using **bus + train** connections.  
Loads data from a JSON file (generated by a `TransportDataGenerator`) and builds a graph of stations; shows the best route and alternatives, and lets users “buy” a ticket (receipt saved to `racuni/`).

## Features
- Choose start/destination city
- Optimize by **time**, **price**, or **transfers**
- Best route details + **Top 5** alternatives
- Graph visualization via **GraphStream**
- Ticket receipts saved to `racuni/`; startup shows total tickets & revenue

## Tech Stack
- Java **21**, JavaFX **21**
- GraphStream **2.0**
- org.json
- Maven (via **Maven Wrapper**)
